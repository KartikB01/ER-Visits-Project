# ER-Visits-Project

This project primarily focused on using Tableau Public to build a dashboard from Healthcare data.
The dataset looked at ER visits from patients and my goal was to visualize the patient demographic and the quality of care received.
I built all the KPIs and charts from the data and then formatted them into a visually pleasing and interactive dashboard that summarizes all the key points from the dataset.
